Assignment #2 

As documented in Slack I had difficulties resolving an error in the inital launch of the program. 

//[nodemon] starting `babel-node index.js`

(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { import dotenv from 'dotenv';
                                                                     ^^^^^^

    // 

    This caused me not to be able to connect the application and further the progress through completion of the program. I spent a number of hours researching the issue and determining a few different fixes however I was unsuccesful in implementing any of them.  I had added two routes to the program, one for comments and one for adding contacts. I also attempted to add testing to the post, comment and user paths in the application.
